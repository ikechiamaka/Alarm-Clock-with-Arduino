This is a sketch for a program to control a clock using a rotary encoder and a button. The clock is displayed on a TM1637 4-digit LED display, and the time is kept using a DS3231 RTC. The program uses the Encoder library, RTClib library, Wire library, and the TM1637 library with the DFMini player library for playing a sound. When the encoder button is pressed for a long time, it enters alarm mode where you can set the alarm. When the encoder button is pressed for a short time, it enters clock setting mode. The alarm and clock setting modes are implemented in the setAlarm() and setclock() functions, respectively. The main logic is in the loop() function, which updates the time displayed on the LED and checks if the button or encoder has been pressed. when the set alarm matches the current time i.e the alarm time is reached, it triggers the df mini player to play the first song in the memory card, please put your desired song in the memory card for the player to see it. this is basically the summary of how the system operates.
